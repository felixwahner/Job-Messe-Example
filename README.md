# Job finder

Job finder is a small application used at a school job fair for young students looking for an apprenticeship.
It features a list of the companies present at the fair and an interactive map that can be used to easily
navigate inside of the school and find the respective booths.
To easily remember which companies to visit you can either add favorites (that are stored throughout the
usage on a device) or filter them by the type of offered jobs.

## Tech

The application uses angular 17 and ionic as a frontend UI framework. The mapping part is built on top of leaflet.js.

## Exhibitor Data

All exhibitor data is stored in a json file `assets/data/exhibitors.json`. The logos are located in `assets/images/logos`.

## Further development

The app is a small side project and not planned to be developed further once the fair has finished. Feel free to fork the
project if you plan to use it for your own purposes.
